say). The attribute "type=written" is used in those cases where
Winston's writing in his diary is represented as quoted thought (e.g.,
"If there is hope," he wrote, "it lies in the Proles.").  If no "rend"
attribute is provided on the Q tag, the value is assumed to be "PRE
ldquo" on the first Q in a series of Qs within the same P unbroken by
#PCDATA and "POST rdquo" on the last Q in the series.  The attribute

the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of
unorthodoxy.</s>

and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under

without a painful mixture of emotions.</s>

a pair of spectacles was perched.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.28.4">It resembled the face of a sheep,

<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.28.5"><name type="person">Goldstein</name>
was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the

— an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have
been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one
with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than
oneself, might be taken in by it.</s>

he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom
of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the
revolution had been betrayed — and all this in rapid
polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style
of the orators of the

<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.28.7">And all the while, lest one
should be in any doubt as to the reality which
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>'s
specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there
marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army — row after row
of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to
the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others
exactly similar.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.28.8">The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed

<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.29.2">The self-satisfied
sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the

produced fear and anger automatically.</s>

was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand
times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books,
his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general
gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his
influence never seemed to grow less.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.29.5">Always there were fresh dupes

its name was supposed to be.</s>

was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there.</s>

rose to a frenzy.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.2">People were leaping up and down in their places and
shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the
maddening bleating voice that came from the screen.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.3">The little
sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening
and shutting like that of a landed fish.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.4">Even

heavy face was flushed.</s>

his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing
up to the assault of a wave.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.6">The dark-haired girl behind
<name type="person">Winston</name>
had begun crying out
<q xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.6.2" rend="PRE=lsquo">Swine! Swine! Swine!</q>
and suddenly she picked up a heavy
Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.7">It struck
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>'s
nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.8">In a lucid moment
<name type="person">Winston</name>
found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel
violently against the rung of his chair.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.9">The horrible thing about the
<name type="event">Two Minutes Hate</name>
was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that
it was impossible to avoid joining in.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.10">Within thirty seconds any
pretence was always unnecessary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.11">A hideous ecstasy of fear and
vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a
sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like
an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a
grimacing, screaming lunatic.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.12">And yet the rage that one felt was an
abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object
to another like the flame of a blowlamp.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.13">Thus, at one moment
<name type="person">Winston</name>'s
hatred was not turned against
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
at all, but, on the contrary, against
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>,
the
<name type="org">Party</name>,
and the
<name type="org">Thought Police</name>;
and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided
heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of
lies.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.14">And yet the very next instant he was at one with
the people
about him, and all that was said of
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
seemed to him to be true.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.30.15">At those moments his secret loathing of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
changed into adoration, and
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a
rock against the hordes of Asia, and
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>,
in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung
about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable
by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of
civilization.</s></p>
            <p xml:id="Oen.1.1.31"><s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.1">It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred
this way or that by a voluntary act.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.2">Suddenly, by the sort
of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away
from the pillow in a nightmare,
<name type="person">Winston</name>
succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to
the dark-haired girl behind him.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.3">Vivid, beautiful hallucinations
flashed through his mind.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.4">He would flog her to death with a rubber
truncheon.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.5">He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of
arrows like
<name type="person">Saint Sebastian</name>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.6">He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.7">Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated
her.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.31.8">He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless,
because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because
round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it
with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive
symbol of chastity.</s></p>
            <p xml:id="Oen.1.1.32"><s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.1">The
<name type="event">Hate</name>
rose to its climax.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.2">The voice of
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face
changed into that of a sheep.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.3">Then the sheep-face melted into the
figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and
terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of
the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row
actually flinched backwards in their seats.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.4">But in the same moment,
drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure
melted into the face of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>,
black-haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm,
and so vast that it almost filled up the screen.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.5">Nobody heard what
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
was saying.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.6">It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of
words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable
individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being
spoken.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.1.32.7">Then the face of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the

stood out in bold capitals:

seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the

off immediately.</s>

forward over the back of the chair in front of her.</s>

she extended her arms towards the screen.</s>

the written instructions which

<s xml:id="Oen.1.4.9.8"><name type="person">Winston</name>,
however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to

<s xml:id="Oen.1.4.11.6">And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy
creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising
talent for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing
garbled versions — definitive texts, they were called — of
poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one
reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies.</s>

destroyed.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.4.11.13">And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the

<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.101.11">A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.101.12">All he wanted

<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.102.3">He went into
the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of
<name type="product">Victory Gin</name>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.102.4">Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary
out of the drawer.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.102.5">But he did not open it at once.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.102.6">From the
telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song.</s>

<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.2">The proper
thing was to kill yourself before they got you.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.3">Undoubtedly some
people did so.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.4">Many of the disappearances were actually suicides.</s>

it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where

unprocurable.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.6">He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological
uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which
always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special
effort is needed.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.7">He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only
he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of
his danger he had lost the power to act.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.8">It struck him that in moments

against one's own body.</s>

in his belly made consecutive thought impossible.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.10">And it is the same,
he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.103.11">On the
battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues
that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body
swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not
paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment
struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour
stomach or an aching tooth.</s></p>

killed was what you expected.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.1.8.104.8">But before death (nobody spoke of such
things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of
confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the floor
and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth,

be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some
description.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.1.15.6">But there was another, wilder possibility that kept
raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.1.15.7">This was,
that the message did not come from the

even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs

she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.1.24.4">The

turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man

<s xml:id="Oen.2.1.24.7">There
was a vacant place at a table further away, but something in the

followed.</s>

right.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.1.24.14">Five seconds later, with a thundering heart,

eating.</s>

began speaking.</s>

remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the helicopter that the

deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and
disease could be eliminated within a few generations.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.9.14.7.13">And in fact,
without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic
process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible
not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards
of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty
years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
centuries.</s></p>
              <p xml:id="Oen.2.9.14.8"><s xml:id="Oen.2.9.14.8.1">But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened

gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such
quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for
breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies;
others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the
soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent
of its base as a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter
possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended
thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial

large scale about ten years later.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.9.14.13.4">At that time some hundreds of bombs
were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia,
Western Europe, and North America.</s>

the end of organized society, and hence of their own

continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the

thirty or forty years.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.9.14.13.9">Helicopters are more used than they were
formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by
self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship has

there has been little development.</s>

strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to themselves
that they are following, is the same.</s>

fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire
a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival
states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and
remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to
sleep.</s>

assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all be fired
simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation

undertaken.</s>

a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of
about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical development
goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.2.9.14.14.13">The problem is the same for
all three super-states.</s>

<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.4">The confession was a formality, though the torture

<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.8">There were times when he rolled about the floor, as
shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an
endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more

shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his
spine.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.9">There were times when it went on and on until the cruel,
wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued
to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing
consciousness.</s>

<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.11">There were other
times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when
every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and

<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.14">Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a
sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate
for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.15">There were also
longer periods of recovery.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.16">He remembered them dimly, because they
were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor.</s>

wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.3.18">He
remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his
hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his
pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh
fingers over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into
his arm to make him sleep.</s></p>
            <p xml:id="Oen.3.2.4"><s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.1">The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror

uniforms but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick
movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over
periods which lasted — he thought, he could not be sure —
ten or twelve hours at a stretch.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.3">These other questioners saw to it
that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that
they relied on.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.4">They slapped his face, wrung his ears. pulled his
hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone
glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim
of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing
and reasoning.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.5">Their real weapon was the merciless questioning that
went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for
him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of
lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame
as from nervous fatigue Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in
a single session.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.6">Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and
threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards
again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him
comrade, appeal to him in the name of
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name>
and
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>,
and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to
the
<name type="org">Party</name>
left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.7">When his nerves
were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce
him to snivelling tears.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.8">In the end the nagging voices broke him down
more completely than the boots and fists of the guards.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.9">He became
simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded
of him.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.3.2.4.10">His sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to
confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started
anew.</s>

distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds,
sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind.</s>

had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as

personal touch with

all true.</s>

<s xml:id="Oen.4.2.2">In the year

as his sole means of communication, either in speech or writing.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.2.3">The
leading articles in the

which could only be carried out by a specialist.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.2.4">It was expected that

would have finally superseded

(or Standard English, as we should call it) by about the year
<date>2050</date>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.2.5">Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use
Newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their
everyday speech.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.2.6">The version in use in
<date>1984</date>,
and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the
<title>Newspeak Dictionary</title>,
was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and
archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.2.7">It is with
the final, perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of
the Dictionary, that we are concerned here.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.3"><s xml:id="Oen.4.3.1">The purpose of
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and
mental habits proper to the devotees of
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name>,
but to make all other modes of thought impossible.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.2">It was intended
that when
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
had been adopted once and for all and
<name type="language">Oldspeak</name>
forgotten, a heretical thought — that is, a thought diverging
from the principles of
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name>
— should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is
dependent on words.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.3">Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact
and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member
could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and
also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.4">This was
done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating
undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of
unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings
whatever.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.5">To give a single example.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.6">The word
<mentioned>free</mentioned>
still existed in
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>,
but it could only be used in such statements as
<q xml:id="Oen.4.3.6.3">This dog is free from lice</q>
or
<q xml:id="Oen.4.3.6.4">This field is free from weeds</q>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.7">It could not be used in its old sense of
<mentioned>politically free</mentioned>
or
<mentioned>intellectually free</mentioned>
since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as
concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.8">Quite apart from
the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary
was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed
with was allowed to survive.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.3.9"><name type="language">Newspeak</name>
was designed not to extend but to
<hi rend="it">diminish</hi>
the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by
cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.4"><s xml:id="Oen.4.4.1"><name type="language">Newspeak</name>
was founded on the English language as we now know it, though many
Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,
would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.4.2">Newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the
A vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C
vocabulary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.4.3">It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but
the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the
section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good
for all three categories.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.5"><s xml:id="Oen.4.5.1"><hi rend="it">The A vocabulary</hi>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.5.2">The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of
everyday life — for such things as eating, drinking, working,
putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in
vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.5.3">It was composed almost
entirely of words that we already possess words like
<mentioned>hit</mentioned>,
<mentioned>run</mentioned>,
<mentioned>dog</mentioned>,
<mentioned>tree</mentioned>,
<mentioned>sugar</mentioned>,
<mentioned>house</mentioned>,
<mentioned>field</mentioned>
— but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary
their number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more
rigidly defined.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.5.4">All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged
out of them.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.5.5">So far as it could be achieved, a
Newspeak word of this
class was simply a staccato sound expressing
<hi rend="it">one</hi>
clearly understood concept.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.5.6">It would have been quite impossible to
use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or
philosophical discussion.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.5.7">It was intended only to express simple,
purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical
actions.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.6"><s xml:id="Oen.4.6.1">The grammar of
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
had two outstanding peculiarities.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.2">The first of these was an almost
complete interchangeability between different parts of speech.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.3">Any
word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract
words such as
<mentioned>if</mentioned>
or
<mentioned>when</mentioned>)
could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.4">Between
the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was
never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of
many archaic forms.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.5">The word
<mentioned>thought</mentioned>,
for example, did not exist in
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.6">Its place was taken by
<mentioned>think</mentioned>,
which did duty for both noun and verb.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.7">No etymological principle was
followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen
for retention, in other cases the verb.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.8">Even where a noun and verb of
kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of
them was frequently suppressed.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.9">There was, for example, no such word
as
<mentioned>cut</mentioned>,
its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb
<mentioned>knife</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.10">Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix
<mentioned>—ful</mentioned>
to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding
<mentioned>—wise</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.11">Thus for example,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">speedful</mentioned>
meant
<mentioned>rapid</mentioned>
and
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">speedwise</mentioned>
meant
<mentioned>quickly</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.12">Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as
<mentioned>good</mentioned>,
<mentioned>strong</mentioned>,
<mentioned>big</mentioned>,
<mentioned>black</mentioned>,
<mentioned>soft</mentioned>,
were retained, but their total number was very small.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.13">There was
little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be
arrived at by adding
<mentioned>—ful</mentioned>
to a noun-verb.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.14">None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,
except for a very few already ending in —wise: the
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">—wise</mentioned>
termination was invariable.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.6.15">The word
<mentioned>well</mentioned>,
for example, was replaced by
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodwise</mentioned>.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.7"><s xml:id="Oen.4.7.1">In addition, any word — this again applied in principle to every
word in the language — could be negatived by adding the affix
<mentioned>un—</mentioned>
or could be strengthened by the affix
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">plus—</mentioned>,
or, for still greater emphasis,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">doubleplus—</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.7.2">Thus, for example,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">uncold</mentioned>
meant
<mentioned>warm</mentioned>,
while
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">pluscold</mentioned>
and
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">doublepluscold</mentioned>
meant, respectively,
<mentioned>very cold</mentioned>
and
<mentioned>superlatively cold</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.7.3">It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the
meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as
<mentioned>ante—</mentioned>,
<mentioned>post—</mentioned>,
<mentioned>up—</mentioned>,
<mentioned>down—</mentioned>
etc.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.7.4">By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous
diminution of vocabulary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.7.5">Given, for instance, the word
<mentioned>good</mentioned>, there was no need for such a word as
<mentioned>bad</mentioned>,
since the required meaning was equally well — indeed, better
— expressed by
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">ungood</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.7.6">All that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural
pair of opposites, was to decide which of them to suppress.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.7.7"><mentioned>Dark</mentioned>,
for example, could be replaced by
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">unlight</mentioned>,
or
<mentioned>light</mentioned>
by
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">undark</mentioned>,
according to preference.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.8"><s xml:id="Oen.4.8.1">The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its
regularity.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.8.2">Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all
inflexions followed the same rules.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.8.3">Thus, in all verbs the preterite
and the past participle were the same and ended in
<mentioned>—ed</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.8.4">The preterite of
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">steal</mentioned>
was
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">stealed</mentioned>,
the preterite of
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">think</mentioned>
was
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">thinked</mentioned>,
and so on throughout the language, all such forms as
<mentioned>swam</mentioned>,
<mentioned>gave</mentioned>,
<mentioned>brought</mentioned>,
<mentioned>spoke</mentioned>,
<mentioned>taken</mentioned>,
etc., being abolished.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.8.5">All plurals were made by adding -s or -es as
the case might be.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.8.6">The plurals of
<mentioned>man</mentioned>,
<mentioned>ox</mentioned>,
<mentioned>life</mentioned>,
were
<mentioned>mans</mentioned>,
<mentioned>oxes</mentioned>,
<mentioned>lifes</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.8.7">Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding
<mentioned>—er</mentioned>,
<mentioned>—est</mentioned>
(<mentioned>good</mentioned>,
<mentioned>gooder</mentioned>,
<mentioned>goodest</mentioned>),
irregular forms and the
<mentioned>more</mentioned>,
<mentioned>most</mentioned>
formation being suppressed.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.9"><s xml:id="Oen.4.9.1">The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect
irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative
adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.9.2">All of these followed their
ancient usage, except that
<mentioned>whom</mentioned>
had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the
<mentioned>shall</mentioned>,
<mentioned>should</mentioned>
tenses had been dropped, all their uses being covered by
<mentioned>will</mentioned>
and
<mentioned>would</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.9.3">There were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out
of the need for rapid and easy speech.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.9.4">A word which was difficult to
utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be
<foreign xml:lang="la">ipso facto</foreign>
a bad word: occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra
letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was
retained.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.9.5">But this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the
B vocabulary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.9.6"><hi rend="it">Why</hi>
so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be
made clear later in this essay.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.10"><s xml:id="Oen.4.10.1"><hi rend="it">The B vocabulary</hi>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.10.2">The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately
constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not
only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to
impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.10.3">Without a full understanding of the principles of
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name>
it was difficult to use these words correctly.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.10.4">In some cases they
could be translated into
<name type="language">Oldspeak</name>,
or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually
demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain
overtones.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.10.5">The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing
whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more
accurate and forcible than ordinary language.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.11"><s xml:id="Oen.4.11.1">The B words were in all cases compound words.<ptr xml:id="Oen.4.11.1.1" rend="asterisk" target="Oen.4.12"/></s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.11.2">They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded
together in an easily pronounceable form.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.11.3">The resulting amalgam was
always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.11.4">To
take a single example: the word
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthink</mentioned>,
meaning, very roughly,
<mentioned>orthodoxy</mentioned>,
or, if one chose to regard it as a verb,
<mentioned>to think in an orthodox manner</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.11.5">This inflected as follows: noun-verb,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthink</mentioned>;
past tense and past participle,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthinked</mentioned>;
present participle,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">good-thinking</mentioned>;
adjective,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthinkful</mentioned>;
adverb,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthinkwise</mentioned>;
verbal noun,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthinker</mentioned>.</s></p>
          <note xml:id="Oen.4.12" place="foot">Compound words such as
<mentioned>speakwrite</mentioned>,
were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were merely
convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.</note>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.13"><s xml:id="Oen.4.13.1">The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.13.2">The words
of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be
placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to
pronounce while indicating their derivation.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.13.3">In the word
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">crimethink</mentioned>
(<foreign xml:lang="ns">thoughtcrime</foreign>),
for instance, the

came second, whereas in
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">thinkpol</mentioned>
(<name type="org">Thought Police</name>)
it came first, and in the latter word
<mentioned>police</mentioned>
had lost its second syllable.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.13.4">Because of the great difficulty in
securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the B
vocabulary than in the A vocabulary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.13.5">For example, the adjective forms
of
<mentioned xml:lang="ns"><name type="org">Minitrue</name></mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns"><name type="org">Minipax</name></mentioned>,
and
<mentioned xml:lang="ns"><name type="org">Miniluv</name></mentioned>
were, respectively,
<mentioned>Minitruthful</mentioned>,
<mentioned>Minipeaceful</mentioned>,
and
<mentioned>Minilovely</mentioned>,
simply because
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">—trueful</mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">—paxful</mentioned>,
and
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">—loveful</mentioned>
were slightly awkward to pronounce.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.13.6">In principle, however, all B
words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.14"><s xml:id="Oen.4.14.1">Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings,
barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the
language as a whole.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.2">Consider, for example, such a typical
sentence from a

leading article as

<name>Ingsoc</name>.</q></s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.3">The shortest rendering that one could make of this in

would be:

emotional understanding of the principles of

<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.4">But this is not an adequate translation.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.5">To begin with, in order to
grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one
would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by
<mentioned><name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name></mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.6">And in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name> could
appreciate the full force of the word
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">bellyfeel</mentioned>,
which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance
difficult to imagine today; or of the word

which was inextricably mixed up with the
idea of wickedness and decadence.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.7">But the special function of certain Newspeak words, of which

was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them.</s>

extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of
words which, as they were sufficiently covered by a single
comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgotten.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.14.9">The greatest
difficulty facing the compilers of the

was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure

consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to
give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary
citizen had no need of them.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.15.15">He knew what was meant by
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodsex</mentioned>
— that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for
the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure
on the part of the woman: all else was
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">sexcrime</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.15.16">In
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought
further than the perception that it was heretical: beyond that point
the necessary words were nonexistent.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.16"><s xml:id="Oen.4.16.1">No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.16.2">A great many
were euphemisms.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.16.3">Such words, for instance, as

(forced-labour camp) or
<mentioned><name xml:lang="ns" type="org">Minipax</name></mentioned>
<name type="org">Ministry of Peace</name>,
i. e.
<name type="org">Ministry of War</name>)
meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.16.4">Some
words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous
understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.16.5">An example was
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">prolefeed</mentioned>,
meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the
<name type="org">Party</name> handed out to the masses.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.16.6">Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation
<mentioned>good</mentioned>
when applied to the
<name type="org">Party</name>
and
<mentioned>bad</mentioned>
when applied to its enemies.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.16.7">But in addition there were great numbers
of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and
which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning, but
from their structure.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.17"><s xml:id="Oen.4.17.1">So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have
political significance of any kind was fitted into
the B vocabulary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.2">The name of every organization, or body of people, or
doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was
invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily
pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would
preserve the original derivation.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.3">In the
<name type="org">Ministry of Truth</name>,
for example, the
<name type="org">Records Department</name>,
in which
<name type="person">Winston Smith</name>
worked, was called
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">Recdep</mentioned>,
the
<name type="org">Fiction Department</name>
was called
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">Ficdep</mentioned>,
the Teleprogrammes Department was called
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">Teledep</mentioned>,
and so on.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.4">This was not done solely with the object of saving
time.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.5">Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped
words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of
political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use
abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries
and totalitarian organizations.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.6">Examples were such words as
<mentioned>Nazi</mentioned>,
<mentioned>Gestapo</mentioned>,
<mentioned>Comintern</mentioned>,
<mentioned>Inprecorr</mentioned>,
<mentioned>Agitprop</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.7">In the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were
instinctively, but in
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
it was used with a conscious purpose.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.8">It was perceived that in thus
abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by
cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to
it.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.9">The words
<mentioned>Communist International</mentioned>,
for instance, call up a composite picture of universal human
brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris
Commune.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.10">The word
<mentioned>Comintern</mentioned>,
on the other hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a
well-defined body of doctrine.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.11">It refers to something almost as easily
recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.12"><mentioned>Comintern</mentioned>
is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas
<mentioned>Communist International</mentioned>
is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least
momentarily.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.13">In the same way, the associations called up by a word
like
<mentioned xml:lang="ns"><name xml:lang="ns" type="org">Minitrue</name></mentioned>
are fewer and more controllable than those called up by
<mentioned><name type="org">Ministry of Truth</name></mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.17.14">This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever
possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to
make every word easily pronounceable.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.18"><s xml:id="Oen.4.18.1">In
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>,
euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of
meaning.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.2">Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it
seemed necessary.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.3">And rightly so, since what was required, above all
for political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable
meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of
echoes in the speaker's mind.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.4">The words of the B vocabulary even
gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much
alike.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.5">Almost invariably these words —
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">goodthink</mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns"><name type="org">Minipax</name></mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">prolefeed</mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">sexcrime</mentioned>,

<mentioned xml:lang="ns"><name>Ingsoc</name></mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">bellyfeel</mentioned>,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">thinkpol</mentioned>,
and countless others — were words of two or three syllables,
with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the
last.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.6">The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once
staccato and monotonous.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.7">And this was exactly what was aimed at.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.8">The
intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not
ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of
consciousness.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.9">For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt
necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a
Party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement
should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as
a machine gun spraying forth bullets.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.18.10">His training fitted him to do
this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the
texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful
ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name>,
assisted the process still further.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.19"><s xml:id="Oen.4.19.1">So did the fact of having very few words to choose from.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.2">Relative to
our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it
were constantly being devised.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.3"><name type="language">Newspeak</name>,
indeed, differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary
grew smaller instead of larger every year.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.4">Each reduction was a gain,
since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to
take thought.</s> 
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.5">Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue
from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at
all.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.6">This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">duckspeak</mentioned>,
meaning
<hi rend="PRE=lsquo;POST=rsquo">to quack like a duck</hi>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.7">Like various other words in the B vocabulary,
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">duckspeak</mentioned>
was ambivalent in meaning.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.19.8">Provided that the opinions which were
quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and
when the
<title rend="it" type="newspaper">Times</title>
referred to one of the orators of the
<name type="org">Party</name>
as a
<mentioned xml:lang="ns">doubleplusgood duckspeaker</mentioned>
it was paying a warm and valued compliment.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.20"><s xml:id="Oen.4.20.1"><hi rend="it">The C vocabulary</hi>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.2">The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted
entirely of scientific and technical terms.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.3">These resembled the
scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same
roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip
them of undesirable meanings.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.4">They followed the same grammatical rules
as the words in the other two vocabularies.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.5">Very few of the C words
had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.6">Any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed
in the list devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than
a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.7">Only a very
few words were common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary
expressing the function of Science as a habit of mind, or a method of
thought, irrespective of its particular branches.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.20.8">There was, indeed,
no word for
<mentioned>Science</mentioned>,
any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently
covered by the word
<mentioned><name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name></mentioned>.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.21"><s xml:id="Oen.4.21.1">From the foregoing account it will be seen that in
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was
well-nigh impossible.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.2">It was of course possible to utter heresies of a
very crude kind, a species of blasphemy.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.3">It would have been possible,
for example, to say
<q xml:id="Oen.4.21.3.1" rend="it"><name type="person">Big Brother</name>
is ungood.</q></s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.4">But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a
self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned
argument, because the necessary words were not available.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.5">Ideas
inimical to
<name xml:lang="ns">Ingsoc</name>
could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be
named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole
groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.6">One could, in
fact, only use
<name type="language">Newspeak</name>
for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the
words back into
<name type="language">Oldspeak</name>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.7">For example,
<q xml:id="Oen.4.21.7.1" rend="it">All mans are equal</q>
was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which
<q xml:id="Oen.4.21.7.2" rend="it">All men are redhaired</q>
is a possible Oldspeak sentence.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.8">It did not contain a grammatical
error, but it expressed a palpable untruth —i.e. that all men
are of equal size, weight, or strength.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.9">The concept of political
equality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly
been purged out of the word
<mentioned>equal</mentioned>.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.10">In
<date>1984</date>,
when
<name type="language">Oldspeak</name>
was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically
existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember their original
meanings.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.11">In practice it was not difficult for any person well
grounded in
<foreign xml:lang="ns">doublethink</foreign>
to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the
possibility of such a lapse would have vanished.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.12">A person growing up
with

as his sole language would no more know that

had once had the secondary meaning of
<hi rend="PRE=lsquo;POST=rsquo">politically equal</hi>,
or that
<mentioned>free</mentioned>
had once meant
<hi rend="PRE=lsquo;POST=rsquo">intellectually free</hi>,
than for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be
aware of the secondary meanings attaching to

and

<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.13">There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his
power to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore
unimaginable.</s>
<s xml:id="Oen.4.21.14">And it
was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing
characteristics of
<name type="language">Newspeak</name> would become more and more pronounced
— its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and
more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses always
diminishing.</s></p>
          <p xml:id="Oen.4.22"><s xml:id="Oen.4.22.1">When

it was possible to read them.</s>
